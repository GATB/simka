# it.
# IRIX's pmake confuses automake (as of version 1.9) if dependency tracking
# is enabled and it is not an in-place build.  Simply disabling dependency
# tracking on IRIX is simpler to implement than detecting pmake, detecting
# when a build is not in-place, and then disabling dependency tracking.
