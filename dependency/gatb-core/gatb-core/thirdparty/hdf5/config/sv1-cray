# This file is part of the HDF5 build script.  It is processed shortly
# after configure starts and defines, among other things, flags for
# the various compile modes.


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compiler flags. The CPPFLAGS values should not include package debug
# flags like `-DH5G_DEBUG' since these are added with the
# `--enable-debug' switch of configure.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Choosing a C Compiler
# ---------------------
#
# The user should be able to specify the compiler by setting the CC
# environment variable to the name of the compiler and any switches it 
# requires for proper operation.  If CC is unset then this script may
# set it.  If CC is unset by time this script completes then configure 
# will try `gcc' and `cc' in that order (perhaps some others too).
#
# Note: Code later in this file may depend on the value of $CC_BASENAME
#       in order to distinguish between different compilers when
#       deciding which compiler command-line switches to use.  This
#       variable is set based on the incoming value of $CC and is only
#       used within this file.

# C Compiler and Preprocessor Flags
# ---------------------------------
#
# Flags that end with `_CFLAGS' are always passed to the compiler.
# Flags that end with `_CPPFLAGS' are passed to the compiler when
# compiling but not when linking.
#
# DEBUG_CFLAGS		Flags to pass to the compiler to create a
# DEBUG_CPPFLAGS	library suitable for use with debugging
#			tools. Usually this list will exclude
#			optimization switches (like `-O') and include
#			switches that turn on symbolic debugging
#			support (like `-g').
#
# PROD_CFLAGS		Flags to pass to the compiler to create a
# PROD_CPPFLAGS		production version of the library.  These
#			usualy exclude symbolic debugging switches
#			(like `-g') and include optimization switches
#			(like `-O').
#
# PROFILE_CFLAGS	Flags to pass to the compiler to create a
# PROFILE_CPPFLAGS	library suitable for performance testing (like 
# 			`-pg').  This may or may not include debugging 
# 			or production flags.
#
# H5_CFLAGS		Flags can be added to this variable which
#			might already be partially initialized.  These 
#			flags will always be passed to the compiler
#			and should include switches to turn on full
#			warnings.  HDF5 attempts to be ANSI and Posix
#			compliant and employ good programming
#			practices resulting in few if any
#			warnings.
#
#			Warning flags do not have to be added to H5_CFLAGS
#			variable if the compiler is the GNU gcc
#			compiler or a descendent of gcc such as EGCS or PGCC.
#
# AM_CFLAGS             Flags added directly into this variable will
#                       be propogated to the compiler wrapper scripts (h5cc,
#                       h5c++, et cetera) in addition to being used to compile 
#                       the library.
#
# These flags should be set according to the compiler being used.
# There are two ways to check the compiler.  You can try using `-v' or 
# `--version' to see if the compiler will print a version string.  You 
# can use the value of $CC_BASENAME which is the base name of the
# first word in $CC (note that the value of CC may have changed
# above).
