# Add libtool shared library version numbers to the HDF5 library

LT_VERS_INTERFACE = 8
LT_VERS_REVISION = 0
LT_VERS_AGE = 0

## If the API changes *at all*, increment LT_VERS_INTERFACE and
## reset LT_VERS_REVISION to 0.
##
## If the API changes but no function signatures are removed or
## changed, also increment LT_VERS_AGE.
## If any functions are removed from the API, or their signatures
## are changed reset LT_VERS_AGE to 0 to indicate that previous
## versions of the API are not necessarily compatible with this
## version.
##
## If the source changes but there are no API changes, increment
## LT_VERS_REVISION.  This will happen automatically when
## bin/h5vers is run, but doing it manually shouldn't hurt
## anything.
##
## Note that this versioning system doesn't attempt to handle
## the effects of the H5_V1_x_COMPAT flag.
##
## Since the revision number is automatically incremented by
## bin/h5vers, don't move LT_VERS_REVISION from the fourth line
## without also editing the script!
