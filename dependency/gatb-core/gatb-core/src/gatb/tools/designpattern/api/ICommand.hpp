/** \brief Interface of what a command is.
 *
 *  This class represents the Design Pattern Command whose purpose is to encapsulate
 *  some processing into a uniform calling procedure, a 'execute' method.
 *
 *  The command concept provides a uniform way for running some work.
 *  This is achieved by refining the execute() method of the ICommand interface.
 *  Doing so makes the actual job encapsulated inside the execute() body; clients
 *  that want to use commands only have to know how to launch them: calling execute().
 *
 *  The further step is to introduce an interface that can manage a list of commands.
 *  For instance, in a dual core architecture, it is possible to launch
 *  two instances of commands in two separated threads, which means we got a parallelization
 *  scheme. It is therefore interesting to define an interface that takes a list of commands
 *  an dispatch them in different threads; we call such an interface a command dispatcher.
 *  Note that an implementation of such a dispatcher can parallelize the commands, but another
 *  implementation can only serialize the commands; so, job parallelization or serialization
 *  is just a matter of choice in the actual implementation of the dispatcher interface.
 *
 *  Sample of use:
 * \code
 * class MyCommand : public ICommand
 * {
 * public:
 *     void execute ()  { printf ("I am doing something there\n"); }
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * \see IDispatcher

/** \brief Dispatching of commands.
 *
 *  Interface that launches several commands.
 *
 *  According to the implementation, the dispatching can be done in a serial or in
 *  a parallelized way.
 *
 *  Note that a post treatment command can be provided and will be launched when all
 *  the commands have finished.
 *
 *  Note that this interface could also be implemented for dispatching commands over a network in order
 *  to use a grid of computers. We could imagine that the commands dispatching consists in
 *  launching some RCP calls, or creating some web services calls. The important point is that, from the
 *  client point of view, her/his code should not change, except the actual kind of IDispatcher instance
 *  provided to the algorithm.
 *
 *  Sample of use:
 *  \code
 *  // We define a command class
 *  class MyCommand : public ICommand, public SmartPointer
 *  {
 *  public:
 *      MyCommand (int i) : _i(i) {}
 *      void execute ()  { printf ("Going to sleep %d...\n", _i);  sleep (_i);  }
 *  private:
 *      int _i;
 *  };
 *
 *  int main (int argc, char* argv[])
 *  {
 *      // We create a list of commands
 *      std::vector<ICommand*> commands;
 *      commands.push_back (new MyCommand(2));
 *      commands.push_back (new MyCommand(5));
 *      commands.push_back (new MyCommand(3));
 *
 *      // We create a commands dispatcher that parallelizes the execution of the commands.
 *      IDispatcher* dispatcher = new Dispatcher ();
 *
 *      // We launch the 3 commands.
 *      dispatcher->dispatchCommands (commands, 0);
 *
 *      // Here, we should be waiting until the second command (that waits for 5 seconds) is finished.
 *
 *      return 0;
 *  }
 *  \endcode
