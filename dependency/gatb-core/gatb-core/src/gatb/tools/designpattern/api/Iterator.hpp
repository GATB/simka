/** \brief  Definition of the Design Pattern Iterator interface.
 *
 *    The Iterator concept is here reified as a template class that knows how to iterate some set of objects.
 *
 *  Actually, the interface has two ways for iterating instances:
 *    1- the 'classic' one in terms of Iterator Design Pattern (see first/next/isDone methods)
 *    2- a callback way (see 'iterate' methods) where some client provides a callback that will be called for each object
 *
 *  There may be good reasons for using one way or another. For instance, the first one may be easier to use by clients
 *  (no extra method to be defined) but may be less efficient because more methods calls will be carried out.
 *
 *  Note that 'iterate' has great subclassing potentiality; by default, its implementation relies on first/isDone/next/currentItem
 *  methods and so can't be faster that the 'classic' way. But specific implementations of Iterator may implement 'iterate'
 *  directly by using inner state of the class, and so without call to  first/isDone/next/currentItem methods.
 *
 *  Note that for optimization point of view, an algorithm prefers to use the 'iterate' way with optimized implementations.
 *
 *  Sample of use:
 *  \code
 *   dp::Iterator<MyType*>* it = new MyIterator ();
 *   for (it->first(); ! it->isDone(); it->next() )
 *   {
 *      // retrieve the current item of some type
 *      MyType* item = it->item ();
 *   }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *
 *  A remark on the STL: the Standard Template Library provides also the iterator concept. For instance, one could write:
 *  \code
 *   std::list<MyType*> l;
 *
 *   // we suppose here that we add some items to the list.
 *
 *   for (std::list<MyType*>::iterator it = l.begin(); it != l.end(); it++)
 *   {
 *      // retrieve the current item of some type
 *      MyType* item = *it;
 *   }
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  We can see the following differences with our own iterator.
 *   \li the iteration loop with the STL needs to know the iterated list, through the beginning iterator 'l.begin()'
 *   and the ending iterator 'l.end()'. In our case, we don't have any reference of the iterated container, we can see
 *   only a reference on the iterator itself.
 *   \li the iteration loop with the STL makes apparent the actual type of the container ('list' in the example), which
 *   is not the case for our iterator, where we can see only the type of the iterated items.
 *   \li the STL iterators can only iterate contents of containers, ie. some items already in memory. Our iterator concept
 *   is more general because it can iterate items that it builds on the fly, without having the whole items mounted in memory.
 *   A typical use is the parsing of a huge FASTA database (say 8 GBytes for instance). With a STL iterator, we should have
 *   the whole sequences lying in some containers before iterating them; with our iterator, it is enough to know a sequence
 *   at a given time. Note however that clients of such iterators must not reference a sequence that is transient by nature.
 *   In such a case, clients have to copy, if needed, the iterated sequence for some local work.
 *
 *  In brief, our iterator encapsulates more information that the STL iterator, allows to iterate potential containers (versus
 *  actual containers) and may be easier to use.
 *
 *  Moreover, we can use our iterator as a basis for other ways for iteration.

/** \brief Interface for listening to iteration progress.
 *
 * This interface is intended to be notified by some progress job, and in particular
 * to the progression of an iteration with an Iterator instance.
 *
 * It defines 3 methods:
 *      - init   : method called just before the beginning of the iteration
 *      - finish : method called just after the end of the iteration
 *      - inc    : method called during the iteration; the provided arguments
 *                 represents the number of iterations before the previous call
 *
 * Actually, this is a little more than just an interface since it provides empty
 * implementations for the 3 methods; this will ease the development to clients who
 * wants only to get 'inc' notifications but are not interested to do specific actions
 * at the beginning and the end of the iteration.
