/** \brief Interface that uses kmer counting information
 *
 * This interface is mainly an Observer that listens to data produced by the sorting
 * count algorithm. Such an information is made of a kmer an the number of occurrences
 * of this kmers in each bank provided to the algorithm.
 *
 * Through this interface, it becomes easy to plug specific listeners that can do
 * different things on the [kmer,counts] information. There is a default implementation
 * of the ICountProcessor interface that does the historical job of DSK:
 *      1) building an histogram
 *      2) filtering out kmers with too low coverage
 *      3) saving on disk kmers having big enough coverage
 *
 * Such an instance can be associated to the SortingCountAlgorithm instance with the
 * SortingCountAlgorithm::setProcessor method; this instance will be called 'prototype
 * instance'.
 *
 * From an execution point of view, one instance of ICountProcessor is created (with method
 * 'clone') for counting the kmers of one specific partition. If N cores are used, it means
 * that N instances of ICountProcessor will be cloned from the so called 'prototype'
 * instance (ie. the instance associated to the SortingCountAlgorithm instance). Each
 * clone processes its partition in one specific thread.
 *
 * While processing a partition, a cloned ICountProcessor instance is called
 * via its 'process' method: this is here that the information [kmer,counts] is
 * provided to the ICountProcessor clone, and accordingly to the actual implementation
 * class of the ICountProcessor interface, different processings can be done.
 *
 * When all the clones have finished their job (in their own thread), the prototype
 * instance is called (in the main thread) via the 'finishClones' method, where
 * the prototype instance has access to the N clones before they are deleted. It allows
 * for instance to gather in the prototype instance the information collected by the clones
 * during their processing.
 *
 * From a global point of view, the interface is made of three parts :
 *      1) methods called on the prototype instance in the context of the main thread
 *      2) methods called on a cloned instance in the context of specific threads
 *      3) all other methods
 *
 * The following figure shows how ICountProcessor interacts with other classes, and in particular
 * with SortingCountAlgorithm. One can also see the multithreading context, with the main thread
 * creating clones and with clones processing their job in specific threads.
 *
 * \image html ICountProcessor.png "Usage and life cycle of ICountProcessor in the context of SortingCountAlgorithm"
 *
 * Examples of ICountProcessor implementors :
 *      1) CountProcessorHistogram   : collect kmers distribution information
 *      2) CountProcessorSolidity... : check whether a kmer is solid or not
 *      3) CountProcessorDump        : dump kmer count information in file system
 *      4) CountProcessorChain       : list of linked ICountProcessor instances
 *
 * The CountProcessorChain implementation allows to link several instances of
 * ICountProcessor. When such an instance is called via 'process', the first item
 * of the list is called via 'process'; if it returns true, the next item in the list
 * is called and so on; if it returns false, the chain is stopped. This class is used
 * for the definition of the "DSK" count processor (histogram -> solidity -> dump)
