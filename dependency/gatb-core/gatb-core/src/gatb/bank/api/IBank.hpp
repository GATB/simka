/** \brief Interface for what we need to read genomic databases.
 *
 * The IBank interface provides means to:
 *  - read sequences from some container.
 *  - insert sequences into some container.
 *
 * One typical implementation of this interface is a FASTA bank parser.
 *
 * The key point here is that clients should use this interface instead of specific
 * implementations, wherever they need to get nucleotides sequences from some container.
 *
 * By doing this, such clients will support many bank formats (according to the fact that
 * a IBank implementation provides such a service). They will also support "fake" banks, for
 * instance random generated sequences or any kind of synthetic data.
 *
 * From a design point of view, IBank is an Iterable (something we can get iterators from) and
 * a Bag (something we can insert items into); in both cases, the item type is Sequence
 *
 * Some kind of factory method exists for using IBank instances: this is the gatb::core::bank::impl::Bank
 * class. This class allows to get a IBank instance by providing an URI. The actual implementation
 * class of the IBank interface is computed by analyzing the URI string itself, or the content of the
 * file defined by the URI. So, tools developers should in general get IBank instances this way, so their
 * tool would support different kind of input bank formats.
 *
 * \see Sequence
 * \see IBankFactory
 * \see impl::Bank
