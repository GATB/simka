# HOW TO DELIVER A NEW RELEASE ?

A delivery is made of two files:
* binary archive
* source archive

To create a new release, simply use the script 'script/make_official_release.sh.

It is worth noting that this script can only be used by Inria's Genscale team members since it requires an access to the officiel GATB-CORE repository hosted on Inria Forge.
